## Paws

Paws is a web app that connects animal adoption NPOs and people looking to adopt.

The goal of this project is to help animals in shelters find forever homes by connecting NPOs to people who are looking to adopt.
There are many features I would still love to add and hope to add in the future, such as:

- Real time chat
- NPO Registration verification

Made with Next js, tailwind, shadcn, supabase & Kinde.
